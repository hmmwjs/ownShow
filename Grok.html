        <h1>Personal Growth Potential Self-Assessment</h1>
        <p>This tool allows you to self-assess your growth potential based on a comprehensive model with three core dimensions: Internal Drivers, Behavioral Strategies, and Systemic Interaction. Each dimension has sub-dimensions with definitions and key indicators explained in tables below.</p>
        <p>Rate yourself on a scale of 1-5 (default: 3) for each sub-dimension. Weights are customizable (default: 1 for each). The radar chart, total score (out of 100), and suggestions update in real-time as you adjust scores and weights.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Dimension Explanations</h2>
            
            <h3>Internal Drivers (Why Grow?)</h3>
            <p>Individual's internal psychological and cognitive framework, serving as the underlying operating system and energy source for growth. Independent of specific behaviors and external environment.</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Sub-Dimension</th><th>Definition</th><th>Key Indicators</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Growth Mindset</td><td>Belief that abilities, intelligence, and talents can be developed through effort, learning, and persistence, rather than being fixed.</td><td>- View challenges as opportunities: Actively seek and enjoy difficult tasks.<br>- Learn from failure: See setbacks and criticism as valuable feedback, not personal denial.<br>- Believe in the value of effort: Consider sustained effort as the path to mastery.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Self-Awareness</td><td>Clear and accurate understanding of one's emotions, core values, strengths, and blind spots.</td><td>- Emotional awareness and management: Accurately identify and effectively regulate emotional states.<br>- Value clarification: Have clear and stable personal core values to guide choices.<br>- Reflection on strengths and weaknesses: Objectively assess own strengths and areas for improvement.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Intrinsic Motivation</td><td>Driven by internal interest, curiosity, sense of achievement, or mission, rather than external rewards or pressure.</td><td>- Interest-driven: Strong curiosity and passion for the field engaged in.<br>- Pursuit of autonomy: Desire to control own work and life, seeking independent decision-making.<br>- Internal sense of achievement: Satisfaction mainly from task completion and personal progress, not external praise.</td></tr>
            </table>

            <h3>Behavioral Strategies (How to Grow?)</h3>
            <p>Methods by which individuals convert internal drives into specific actions and continuously optimize action outcomes. Independent of inner thoughts and external resources.</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Sub-Dimension</th><th>Definition</th><th>Key Indicators</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Proactive Learning</td><td>Active and continuous habit of acquiring, integrating, and applying new knowledge and skills.</td><td>- Efficient information acquisition: Quickly filter, absorb, and understand key information.<br>- Deliberate practice and iteration: Consciously practice in the "learning zone" and improve through feedback.<br>- Knowledge transfer application: Flexibly apply knowledge or skills from one field to solve problems in others.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Grit & Execution</td><td>Maintaining passion and perseverance for long-term goals, showing strong resilience in the face of difficulties and setbacks.</td><td>- Long-term goal focus: Break down long-term goals and persistently work towards them without short-term distractions.<br>- Resilience: Quickly adjust mindset after failure, learn lessons, and re-engage.<br>- Habit formation ability: Systematically turn key behaviors into long-term, stable habits.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Adaptive Flexibility</td><td>Ability to quickly adjust strategies, goals, and behaviors to adapt to new situations in uncertain environments.</td><td>- Rapid skill iteration: Quickly learn and master new skills to maintain competitiveness based on environmental changes.<br>- Strategy adjustment ability: Flexibly conceive and execute alternative plans when original plans no longer apply.<br>- Cognitive flexibility: View problems from multiple angles, not sticking to a single thinking mode.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Applied Innovation</td><td>Ability to convert ideas and knowledge into practical solutions and make creative improvements in practice.</td><td>- Problem reframing ability: Break out of traditional frameworks to redefine the core of problems.<br>- Hands-on problem-solving: Emphasize validation and optimization of ideas through practice, experiments, and prototypes.<br>- Value creation orientation: Ultimate goal of actions is to create new, valuable outcomes (products, services, processes, etc.).</td></tr>
            </table>

            <h3>Systemic Interaction (With What to Grow?)</h3>
            <p>Ability of individuals to connect, collaborate, and exchange value with the external world (including people, organizations, information, and resources). Independent of personal internal state and independent actions.</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Sub-Dimension</th><th>Definition</th><th>Key Indicators</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Effective Communication</td><td>Clearly and precisely convey information, ideas, and emotions, and actively listen and understand others.</td><td>- Expression clarity and logic: Organize and express views in an orderly and logical manner.<br>- Active listening and empathy: Focus on listening and accurately understand the other's intentions and emotions.<br>- Constructive feedback: Give and receive honest, specific, actionable feedback.</td></tr>

                <tr><td>Network Building & Leverage</td><td>Ability to build, maintain, and utilize high-quality interpersonal networks to gain information, support, and opportunities.</td><td>- Build diverse connections: Actively establish meaningful contacts with people from different backgrounds and fields.<br>- Seek and provide value: In social networks, actively seek help and willingly provide value to others.<br>- Integrate external resources: Skillfully use interpersonal networks and external tools/platforms to amplify personal efforts and solve complex problems.</td></tr>
